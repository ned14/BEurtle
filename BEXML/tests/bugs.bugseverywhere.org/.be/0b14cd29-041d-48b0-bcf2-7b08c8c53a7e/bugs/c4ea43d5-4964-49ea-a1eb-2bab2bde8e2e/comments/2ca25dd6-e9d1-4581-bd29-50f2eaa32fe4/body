When running `python test.py` I recieved lots of errors due to 'tla'
(the GNU Arch revision control system binary) not being installed.
I had expected test.py to only test the backends for installed VCSs.

I've added a note saying that `python test.py` tests *all* the
backends, but someone who understands the usage better can probably
write a nicer version.
