Keeping the bug data with the source helps synchronize bug state and
source code.  Bug state in branch A may not apply to branch B.  Some
people like to weaken this source-bug linkage by keeping their bugs in
a branch all by themselves (ditz [http://ditz.rubyforge.org/]
currently supports this workflow).  It sounds like you want to move
from "bugs with code" to "bugs and code in separate branches".  We
don't have an easy way to do that in BE at the moment, since
version-control systems like Git have a single working branch at a
time (I think :p).  What VCS are you using as a backend?

  be comment ID "See the tarball at http://yourpage/something.tar.gz"
Then to grab the tarball, you'd use:
  wget `be show COMMENT-ID | sed -n 's/ *See the tarball at //p'`
to grab it.
