The bug state is as complete as the source code state. It's exactly as
aggregated as the rest of the source code; the “complete bug state”
would be the integration branch where you merge all the feature branches
and bug-fix branches together.

If instead you want bugs to *not* be tightly linked with the rest of the
source code state, it seems you don't want a distributed bug tracker
like Bugs Everywhere.
