Hello

Just a question and only for curiosity: there is an easy way to determine the 
target succession ?

For example, let's assume we have target a, b, c
There is a way to know that  "a" is a past target, "b" is the current target 
and "c" is a future target ? More: there is a way to know if a target is 
closed or open ?

thanks

bye
Gianluca
