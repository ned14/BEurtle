Good idea

Nice. But instead of moving all bugs to the next date-due target, I'd prefer 
to leave the choice to the user

I don't see these as problems per se. We can have two cases:

1) a personal branch (like my html output or Trevor's email interface). In 
this case there is not any problem to decide the due date

2) a branch with a group of delopers (let it be the canonical branch o an 
experimental branch): in this case I suppose that working together means to be 
able to agree on some things

In any case, having the possibility to set a due date does not means that it 
is obligatory to do it and should be a good idea to offer as many possibilities 
as we can to the users of BE
