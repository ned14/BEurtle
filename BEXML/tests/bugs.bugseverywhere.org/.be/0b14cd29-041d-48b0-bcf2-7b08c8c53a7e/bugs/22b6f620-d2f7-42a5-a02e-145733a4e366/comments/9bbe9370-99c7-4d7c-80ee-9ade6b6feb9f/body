Another option would be a "blocked by" field, since you might miss
deadlines, or have parallel targeted branches.  Or just pick target
names following some scheme so the alphanumeric-sort is also a
dependency-order sort ;).

There's also
  $ be list --target 0.1
If there are active bugs, the target is open.  Otherwise, you must have
made it ;).

for bug in `be list --target 0.1 --uuids`; do
  be target $bug $NEXT_TARGET
done

To avoid the loop, we could change status, severity, target, etc from
  be COMMAND BUG ARG
to
  be COMMAND ARG BUG [MORE BUGS ...]
