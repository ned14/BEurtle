Fairly amazingly, one can actually pipe a file to stdin on Windows using 'type' instead of 'cat'. I didn't know that. Anyway, the only other 'bug' is that BE is VERY slow on an Intel Atom netbook. We're talking seconds per command execution. I don't know what you're doing under the bonnet there, but there is no algorithmic reason why this should be slow - git just absolutely flies on the Atom. I only wish Visual Studio moved more swiftly on the Atom! Thanks, Niall
