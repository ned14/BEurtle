Since we'll be distributing a non-bzr-repo version, it would be nice
to adapt our 'submit bug' procedure
  $ be new "The demuxulizer is broken"
  Created bug with ID 48f
  $ be comment 48f
  <Describe bug>
  $ bzr commit --message "Reported bug in demuxulizer"
  $ bzr send --mail-to "be-devel@bugseverywhere.org"
to one that works with this setup.  Without guaranteed versioning,
that would probably be something along the lines of
  $ be new "The demuxulizer is broken"
  Created bug with ID 48f
  $ be comment 48f
  <Describe bug>
  $ be email-bugs [--to be-devel@bugseverywhere.org] 48f
With interfaces/email/interactive listening on the recieving end to
grab new-bug emails and import them into an incoming bug repository.
