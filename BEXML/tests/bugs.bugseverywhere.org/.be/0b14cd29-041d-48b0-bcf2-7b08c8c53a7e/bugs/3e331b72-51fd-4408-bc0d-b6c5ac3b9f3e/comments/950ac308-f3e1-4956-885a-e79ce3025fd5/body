This creates an interesting situation:
  Person P subscribes to bug B in repo R.
  Repo S merges repo R.
  Person Q comments on B in S.
  S notifies P :).
which is nice.  However
  Person P subscribes to bug B in repo R.
  Person Q comments on B in repo S.
  R merges S.
  P never notified about Q's comment.
