I think the idea behind my first approach was "you guys have
experience with the command line BE interface, so it will be easier to
test if you don't have to learn the DBT interface."  The Debian people
have been doing this for a while though, so I imagine their email
interface is pretty good ;).

Here's a short primer on my take on the DBT interface.

The DBT has three main email addresses, each with it's own parsing style.
  1) creating bugs (submit@bugs.debian.org)
  2) commenting on bugs (<bug-number>@bugs.debian.org)
  3) controlling/managing bugs (control@bugs.debian.org)
I'm trying to squeeze these down into a single email address to avoid
having to tinker with the mail delivery system, so I've got everything
at (wking at tremily dot us) with subject tags:
  1) creating bugs
     Subject: [be-bug:submit] new bug summary ...
  2) commenting on bugs
     Subject: [be-bug:<bug-number>] human-specific subject
  3) control
     Subject: [be-bug] human-specific subject

The parsing styles each follow their DBT counterparts, but currently
have a much restricted breadth.

The control-style consists of a list of allowed be commands, with one
command per line.  Blank lines and lines beginning with '#' are
ignored, as well anything following a line starting with '--'.  All the
listed commands are executed in order and their output returned.

The comment-style interface appends a comment to the bug specified in
the subject tag.  The the first non-multipart body is attached with
the appropriate content-type.  In the case of "text/plain" contents,
anything following a line starting with '--' is stripped.

The create-style interface creates a bug whose summary is given by the
email's post-tag subject.  The body of the email must begin with a
psuedo-header containing at least the "Version" field.  Anything after
the pseudo-header and before a line starting with '--' is, if present,
attached as the bugs first comment.

Take a look at my interfaces/email/interactive/examples for some
examples.
