I think I agree with both of you. :) It seems like it's both true that
there's no point in keeping a GNU-style ChangeLog these days, and that
if we make a release we should write an announce mail that directly
mentions new user-visible changes as well as attaching the commit log.
That smaller list of highly user-visible changes could live in NEWS,
or in the announce mail, or both.

I'm happy to do this if people think it would be useful, and I don't
yet have a strong opinion on whether the releases should come with
version numbers or timestamps.

Thanks,
