  I hadn't even seen that change go in.  The last upstream change in the
version I have installed locally was by you on 2008-11-24.

  Maybe for others.  Our packages just don't have the manpage as it is only
the "be help" text reformatted, the easy option is sometimes the right
one :)  Also, I've just noticed that it has even less documentation in
the bzr tree[1] making its installation much less compelling unless your
packaging rules require a man page like Debians.

  Out of curiosity why is the Makefile being used for this stuff anyway?
It is going to make it difficult to build locally when we finally get
around to merging.  Examples: If distutils was being used exclusively it
would fix the #! lines in xml/*.  We'd be able to point Python
$version_of_the_day at setup.py instead of having to sed the Makefile or
run setup and manually install other files.

Thanks,
