Right, that should change.

Please, no. Timestamps aren't version strings, that's conflating two
pieces of information with very different meanings. Correlating the two
is the job of a changelog.

The English word “should” is ambiguous in this context. Are you saying
this is desirable, or are you predicting that it will likely be the
case?

I don't see how it's either, so am doubly confused :-)

The convention for three-part version strings is often:

  * Major release number (big changes in how the program works,
    increasing monotonically per major release, with “0”indicating no
    major release yet)

  * Minor release number (smaller impact on how the program works,
    increasing monotonically per minor release, with “0” indicating no
    minor release yet since the previous major)

  * Patch release number (bug-fix and other changes that don't affect
    the documented interface, increasing monotonically per patch
    release, with “0” indicating no patch release since the previous
    major or minor)

Obviously there's no standard or enforcement for this, but that's the
interpretation I usually give to dotted version strings in the absence
of more formal declaration specific to the project.

I disagree with your interpretation and prefer mine, above; on that
basis, I agree that we're at least up to version 0.1 by now :-)
