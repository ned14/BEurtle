I don't think anyone's changing their mind ;), so tallying the
comments so far:

+1 for trunk version number.

+1 for trunk version number.

+1 for by hand version bumps.

+1 for trunk version number.

And me with my timestamps ;).

Sounds like we should go with trunk version number, but that it should
be set by hand whenever Chris decides to release something, since the
rest of us don't know what version the trunk is on.  Unless we do
something like:
  bzr log -n 0 | grep -B2 'nick: be$' | head -n1 | sed 's/ *revno: \([0-9]*\).*//'
to extract the last trunk commit referenced from our branch.

Implementation preferences? (i.e. Chris vs. regexp matching :p)
