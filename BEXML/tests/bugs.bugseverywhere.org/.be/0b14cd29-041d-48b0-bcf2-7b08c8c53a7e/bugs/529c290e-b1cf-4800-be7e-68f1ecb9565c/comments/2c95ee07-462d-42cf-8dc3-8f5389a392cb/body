This is how we develop bzr itself.  The mainline is controlled by PQM,
which is a tool that merges feature branches, runs the tests, and
commits only if the tests pass.

We don't do that.  We have official releases every 4 weeks, but we do
believe that running bzr.dev is pretty safe, because it's always tested
and our test suite is quite thorough.
