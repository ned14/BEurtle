That's not a changelog, that's a commit log of every source-level commit
made. Far too much detail for a changelog of *user-visible* changes
associated with a release.

I still disagree that a timestamp is the right thing to use there. If
you want a monotonically-increasing indicator of which revision we're up
to, that's immediately available with the revision number from VCS on
the main branch. That also has the advantage of producing consecutive
numbers for each revision, by definition.

I agree that's a problem. I think the solution is to start making
releases, with specific version strings, as source tarballs.

Even better: ‘bzr export /tmp/foo.tar.gz’ will create a source tarball
of all the files in the branch's VCS inventory. All we need to do is
start the practice of tagging a release in the VCS, and export the
tarball at that time.
