as an user of be that plans to try and "package" it for openembedded,
a release would be very useful: writing a recipe that downloads a
specific commit from bzr and builds it is probably feasible, but
definitely not ideal.

I also have a weak preference for version numbers, as long as they
give useful informations on the state the release.
