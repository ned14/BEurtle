It might be a good idea for "be html" to use the CherryPy web interface
that Steve is working on.  The command could start up the CherryPy app
and scrape all of the available pages to get a stand-alone dump; this
would avoid having to keep two (okay, more than two at this point)
separate sets of HTML templates in the source tree.  What do you think?

I agree that becommands/*.py commands should not contain any HTML
layout code.  Putting it somewhere else instead sounds fine.

Thanks!
