Yes, definitely. I can see it being a very easy way to put one's bug
database online for browsing.

Instead of a separate command for each output format, could we have a
single “produce a static report of the bug database” command, and
specify output format as an option?

How about:

    be report
    be report --format ascii
    be report --format rst
    be report --format html

Where the ‘--format’ option has a default of, e.g., “ascii”.

This would mean that you are implementing the ‘html’ format of this
putative command.

This sounds quite sensible to me. The existence of a command implies a
module of the same name in ‘becommand’, but there's no necessary
implication that that module can't import modules from elsewhere to do
its work.
