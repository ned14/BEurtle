Hello to everyone

As i said in a previous mail, I am working on a "html" command for be. 
The goal is to be able to do something like "be html /web/page" to have in the 
/web/page directory some static html pages that basically are the dump of the 
be repository, much like ditz have
This will enable a simple and fast publish of the bus list and details on the 
web, at least in read only mode.

So I'd like to ask some question:
1) is it ok to develop this command ? I know that this is not a fully featured 
web interface, but I am sure that it can be usefull.

I am open to suggestion about it of course.

2) I see that every command is implemented with a python file in the becommand 
dir. For a better code, I'd like to split the command implementation into two 
files: a file that contain the actual code and a second  file that have the html 
related part, any problem with this ? I don't like to have the html part and 
the code part in one big and unreadable file.

I'd like to hear other opinion about this.

Thanks for now
bye
Gianluca
