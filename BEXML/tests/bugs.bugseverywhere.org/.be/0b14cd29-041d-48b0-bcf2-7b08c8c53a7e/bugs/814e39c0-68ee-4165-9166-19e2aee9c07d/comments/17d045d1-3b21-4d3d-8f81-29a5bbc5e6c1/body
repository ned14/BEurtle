How will we handle diffs between with revisions with different
schema.py?  This re-raises bea86499-824e-4e77-b085-2d581fa9ccab/ed5eac05-80ed-411d-88a4-d2261b879713/c664b7be-ded5-42dd-a16a-82b2bdb52e36 (bea86499-824e-4e77-b085-2d581fa9ccab/1100c966-9671-4bc6-8b68-6d408a910da1/bd1207ef-f97e-4078-8c5d-046072012082), but we
_expect_ schema.py to evolve, while before we had expected on-disk
versions to stabilize.
