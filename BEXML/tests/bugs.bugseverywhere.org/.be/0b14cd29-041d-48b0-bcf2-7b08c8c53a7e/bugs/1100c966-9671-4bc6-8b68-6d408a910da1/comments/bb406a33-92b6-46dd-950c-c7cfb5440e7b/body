Rather than all the hackery that goes on with email-bugs, the email
interface, etc., it would be nice for distribution if be provided a
uniform issue/bug tracking library and a number of interfaces and
backends.

Current backends:
  filesystem (with assorted VCSs)
Current UIs:
  command line (be)
  email (be-handle-mail)
  web (CFBE)

Future backend architecture:
  be --repo REPO ...
where --repo REPO replaces and extends the current --dir DIR.  Example
REPOs could be
  path/to/repo                              (the current DIR)
  http://some-server.com:port/path/to/repo  (http interface)
  mysql://user@server:port/?db=db-name;pwd=password
  ...
Each repo would have to support a few get/set commands at the bugdir,
bug, and comment level.

The UIs would all load BugDir(REPO), and thus be backend agnostic.
This way a GUI app that let you work on your own machine could also be
used to work on a public repository.  Setting up a public repository
would just consist of exposing one of the wire-capable REPO formats
(e.g. http via a future `be serve MY-URL`) with public write
permissions.
