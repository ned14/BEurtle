Steve's also versioning it with Mercurial.  Will he mind changing to
Bazaar?

Steve, I've touched up CFBE to work with my current BE branch.  Some
of the changes apply to the trunk BE, and hopefully the rest will
soon.  I think the version-naming issue is what's currently blocking
their adoption ;).  I've put up my CFBE branch at
  static-http://www.physics.drexel.edu/~wking/code/hg/cfbe
for Mercurial.

Everyone, should CFBE-specific discussions move off-list?  More
generally, I've been sending in lots of what-I'm-working on messages,
but not hearing much back, so let me know if I'm being too obnoxious,
and I'll shut up (or at least move more off-list) ;).

Cheers,
Trevor
