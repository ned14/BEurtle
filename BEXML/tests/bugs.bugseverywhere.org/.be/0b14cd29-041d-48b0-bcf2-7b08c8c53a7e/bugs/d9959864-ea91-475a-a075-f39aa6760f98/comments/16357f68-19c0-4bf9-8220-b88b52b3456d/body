Hi everyone.  I found Bugs Everywhere and really like the idea of  
distributed bug tracking.  I felt like practicing building a CherryPy  
site so I put together a quick web interface to BE.  I know there's  
already a TurboGears one in the works, but I needed an excuse to try  
out CherryPy again after working with Django for a while.

Would any of you be willing to take a look at what I've got so far and  
tell me what you think I could improve?

To install and use it:

* Install CherryPy from http://cherrypy.org/ if you don't have it.
* Install Jinja2 from http://jinja.pocoo.org/2/ if you don't have it.
* Install BugsEverywhere - you probably know how to do this :)
* Download a zip/tar of my project (or hg clone) from http://bitbucket.org/sjl/cherryflavoredbugseverywhere/
* Unzip my project and put the folder in your Python site-packages  
directory.
* Symlink site-packages/cherryflavoredbugseverywhere/cfbe.py to /usr/ 
local/bin/cfbe
* Use the "cfbe [project_root]" command to start up the web interface  
for that project.
* Visit http://localhost:8080/ in a browser.

I know that's a lot of steps.  I'd like to streamline it quite a bit,  
but first I wanted to see if you have any feedback on the system  
itself. Thanks!
