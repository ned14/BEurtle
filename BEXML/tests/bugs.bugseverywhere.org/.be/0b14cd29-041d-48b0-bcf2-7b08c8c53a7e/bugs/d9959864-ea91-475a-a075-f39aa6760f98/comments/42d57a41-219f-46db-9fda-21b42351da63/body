This looks awesome, thanks!  I've taken some screenshots for others to
see:

My initial impression is that this looks good enough already to merge as
a replacement for the turbogears site.  What does everyone else think?

Could you explain a little about how you handle authorship of bug
changes at the moment, and if it looks plausible to try making it
multiuser?  (Having it handle more than one "user" logged in at once.)

Great work, thanks!
