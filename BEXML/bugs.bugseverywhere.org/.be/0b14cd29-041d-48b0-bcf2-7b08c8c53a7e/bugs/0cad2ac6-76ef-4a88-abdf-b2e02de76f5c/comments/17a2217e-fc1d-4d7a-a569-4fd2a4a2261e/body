It looks like the problems with the git backend are more than just in the
site-init command.  It looks like several places expect that git_dir_for_path
and git_repo_for_path return absolute paths, while in the current
implementation, it may not be the case.  Here is an updated patch to fix this.
This replaces the previous patch that I gave in this bug.  It seems to work for
me, but I haven't heavily tested it.
