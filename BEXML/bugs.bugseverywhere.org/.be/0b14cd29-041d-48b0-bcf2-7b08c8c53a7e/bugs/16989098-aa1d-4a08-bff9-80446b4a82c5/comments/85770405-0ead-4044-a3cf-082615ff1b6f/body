Access to the (parsed) logs will be important for pretty-printing
bugdir/bug/comment change logs.  Since we do version the bug
repository, users will expect us to be able to list the history for
any particular item (e.g. for "last activity" timestamps, automatic
reminder emails, whatever).  While it does not necessarily need to be
able to delve into old storage formats, it does need to get
implemented.  It's probably worth encapsulating changes in something
like a list of Diff() objects, although it might be worth linking
along bug lines, etc., like VCS annotation.
