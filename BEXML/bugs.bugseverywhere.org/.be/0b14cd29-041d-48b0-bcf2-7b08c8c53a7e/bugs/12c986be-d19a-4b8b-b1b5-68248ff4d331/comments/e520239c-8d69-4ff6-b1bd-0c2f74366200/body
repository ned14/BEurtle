What is your definition of “all branches”? When I'm working with
distributed VCS, I create branches wherever I feel like, and the VCS
tool doesn't have some central registry of branches to keep up to date.

How is a tool to determine the set of “all branches”? The distributed
VCS model means that set is indeterminate.
