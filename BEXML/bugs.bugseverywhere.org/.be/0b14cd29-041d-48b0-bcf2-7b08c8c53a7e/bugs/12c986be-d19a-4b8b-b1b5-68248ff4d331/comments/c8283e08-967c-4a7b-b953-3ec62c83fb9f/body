In the first main Ronny spoke about "public" branches. To me it means that
if a branch is public, he should like to have a status of that branch.

We all agree (probably ;-) ) that tha main branch is the "right" branch, but
as I see it, Ronny's question has some logic.
I'd like to know that a certain bug is fixed in a certain branch, also if it
is still not merged in the main branch, for various reason (ie I am interested
in the solution since the bug stop my work) 

Imagine it like a rss feed aggregator: in one place there are all the bugs of
all the branches that the developers make avaible to the public with 
a repository. This can make easier the life to who want to try a something
since he know what branch he must check out, instead of checking all the 
branch he can find to test if he get what is looking for.

Unluckyly I have no idea how to solve it. :-(
