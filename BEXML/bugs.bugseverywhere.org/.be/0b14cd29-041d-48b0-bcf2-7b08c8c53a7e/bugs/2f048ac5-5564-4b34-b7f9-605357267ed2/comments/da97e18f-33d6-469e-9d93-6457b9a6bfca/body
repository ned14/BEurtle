It can be do, but this implies that CherryPy must be installed and configured, 
a thing that I don't want to impose. My idea is to offer a simpler way to have 
some html pages, where you just need to have BE installed.

My very first implementation was a script that parse directly the .be directory 
to build the pages, without BE itself installed.

I am in doubt with the "somewhere else", since for now I put the html template 
into a separate file in the same directory. Suggestion ?
