I'd really like to have some sort of web interface for  BE, also in read-only 
mode.

I am thinking to write (actually I wrote some test code) a tool to parse a BE 
repository to output a set of static html pages to put online, like the "ditz 
html" command, but this was before I start to play with BE sourcecode, so now 
I ma thinking to implement it as a BE command.

I think that a simple web interface should be read-only. 

Eventually, to allow to add issues also from the web interface, it should be 
done to a specific branch, one commit per change.  

just my 2 cents...
