I finally did something towards a useful interactive email interface
;).  As per our new guidelines, I'll develop this feature in it's own
branch:
  http://www.physics.drexel.edu/~wking/code/bzr/be-email

The interface is basically "place your be command in the subject line"
with a few exceptions.  Some examples:
  Subject: [be-bug] list --status=all
  Subject: [be-bug] show --xml ID
  Subject: [be-bug] new
  Subject: [be-bug] comment ID
In the case of "new", the bug description is extracted from the first
non-blank body line.  In the case of "comment", the email body is used
as the comment.  Currently only "list", "show", "new", and "comment"
are allowed.

You should get a reply email with exit status, stdout, and stderr from
your command.

Send some mail to [wking (at) tremily (dot) us] to try it out!  Depending
on spam attraction, this might be a limited time offer ;).

Hopefully this lowers the entry barrier for bug reporting :).

Disclaimer: I imaging the current implementation will choke on
non-text/plain content types.  Also possibly on non-ascii encodings.
Probably lots of other bugs too... ;).  For example, I should probably
allow the "help" command ... ;).

Cheers,
Trevor
