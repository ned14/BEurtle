Ah, it's been a good day :).  My email interface now supports bug
creation/comments that look like:

    $ cat | mail -s "[be-bug] new" "whatever-dev@fancyprojects.com"
    The demuxulizer is broken
    
    <describe bug>
    ^D

Which is probably easy enough for just about anybody ;).  Also easy
for other projects to wrap into one of their tools:

    $ cat | projectAexecutable --report-bug
    The demuxulizer is broken
    
    <describe bug>
    ^D

Which could do things like automatically add the version string, OS
name, etc.
