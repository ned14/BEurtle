I would far prefer an interface of “place as many BE commands as you
like at the top of the message body, ending with an optional terminator
command, and they will each be executed in turn”.

This would allow a single message to perform a batch of BE commands that
are related, instead of requiring to send each command in a separate
message.

It would also leave the subject field free for something more
descriptive. The subject field could also be used as the summary field
of newly-created bug reports. With a terminator command, this would
allow the message to be sent both to BE and to some other recipient
(e.g. a mailing list) explaining the change.

Have a look at the email interface of the Debian BTS for an example
