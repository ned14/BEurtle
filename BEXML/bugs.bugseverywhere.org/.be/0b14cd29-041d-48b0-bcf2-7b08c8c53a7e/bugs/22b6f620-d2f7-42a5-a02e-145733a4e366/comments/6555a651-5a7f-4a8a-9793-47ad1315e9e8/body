We could add a "date due" field for each target.

We could add a "target close" operation that moves all open bugs
assigned to one target to the next date-due target.

I see problems with these ideas in general, because we're assuming
agreement by all parties/branches on when a target's date due is.
Maybe it's okay to demand that social conventions be used to handle
such a disagreement, or maybe not.
