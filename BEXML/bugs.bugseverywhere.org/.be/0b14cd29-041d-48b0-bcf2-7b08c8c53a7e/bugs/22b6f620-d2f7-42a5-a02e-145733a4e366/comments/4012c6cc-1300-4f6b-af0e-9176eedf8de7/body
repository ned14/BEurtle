I've been mulling this over, and I think that targets are a lot like
bugs.  Here's a list of issue/implementation pairs:

  * Targeting normal bugs

  With "be depend".  I think we should remove the "target" field from
  bugs, and move target dependencies over into the "be depend"
  framework.  Of course, we could add "blocks" (in addition to the
  current "blocked-by") tags to make target lookup more efficient.

  * "due_by"

  We could add "due-by" to Bug.extra_strings as well, so that anyone
  could set due dates for any issue they wanted.

  * Bugdir-wide target

  Just a pointer to the current target bug.

  * Target dependency tree / time-series.
  
  Use BLOCKS/BLOCKED-BY tags between targets, so you'd know which ones
  came first.

  * be target list

  Would become "be list --severity target".  A target "severity" would
  keep target bugs distinct from other bug/issue types.

  * Commenting on targets
  
  They'd be Bug()s, so commenting already build in, e.g. to add
  release notes, layout roadmaps, etc.

If you want, we could maintain the current "be target" interface,
and just use all this stuff behind the scenes.

Thoughts?
