Hey, I haven't touched the web interface in a while, but I should have  
some time to fix some stuff up tonight and tomorrow. Hold off on  
merging it in until then.

I'm still curious as to what people think the role of a web interface  
like this should be. When I wrote it I meant it as a single-user  
interface like the command line one. It could definitely work as a  
public, read-only interface too.

If the goal is to allow more than one person to add issues, how should  
commits go? One commit per change? Commit every X minutes if necessary?
