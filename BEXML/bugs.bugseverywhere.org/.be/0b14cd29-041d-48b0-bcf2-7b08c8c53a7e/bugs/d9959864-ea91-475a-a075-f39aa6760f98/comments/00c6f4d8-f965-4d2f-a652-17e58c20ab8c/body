Hi,

Cool!  I've set up a copy here:

   http://bugsweb.bugseverywhere.org/

(Since we don't have any open bugs lately, click "Closed" at the top,
or create some, but don't expect them to persist if you do.)

   > anyone has any feedback (on any aspect of it) I'd appreciate it.

I'm pretty enthusiastic about merging this and then working on it
further.

Thanks,

- Chris.
