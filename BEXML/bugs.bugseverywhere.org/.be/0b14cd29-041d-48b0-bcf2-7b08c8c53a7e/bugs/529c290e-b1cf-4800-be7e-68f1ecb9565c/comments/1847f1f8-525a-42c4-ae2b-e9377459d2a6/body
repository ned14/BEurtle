It would make it much easier on the Debian package maintainer if the
Bugs Everywhere project would make conventional tarball releases, with
conventional version numbers, with a changelog describing what has
changed between versions.

Trying to maintain a package of a project that is only made available by
undifferentiated VCS revision numbers is a lot more effort, and so
doesn't happen very often.
