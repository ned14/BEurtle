Currently setup.py sets the version number for BE to 0.0.193 and the
url to http://panoramicfeedback.com/opensource/.  These are both a bit
outdated ;).  I've switched my branch over to the current url, and
moved to last-commit-timestamp version numbers.  This removes the
"prefered branch" issues with the old scheme, and version numbers
should increase monotonically, but it looses any stability information
suggested by the preceding 0.0.

We can add those back in if people want.  Does the first 0 mean
"interfaces in flux" and the second 0 mean "lots of bugs"?  If so, I
think we're up to 0.1, since the major features are pretty calm.
