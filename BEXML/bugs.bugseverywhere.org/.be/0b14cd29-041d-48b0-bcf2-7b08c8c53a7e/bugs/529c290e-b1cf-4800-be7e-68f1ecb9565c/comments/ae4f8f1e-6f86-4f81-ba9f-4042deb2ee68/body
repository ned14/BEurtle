Thinking about this some more, I think that the role of the
main-branch is to officially sanction the current state of the code as
"released".  If a series of commits will leave a branch in a
known-unusable form, they should be carried out in some appropriately
named development branch.  Then the log of commits to the main branch
("bzr log -n 1" for bzr > ) should produce a fairly respectable
changelog.  Obviously we are all quite guilty of doing most of our
development in single branches, but it may be a useful model going
forward.  This also means that _every_commit_ to a main branch would
be an official release.
