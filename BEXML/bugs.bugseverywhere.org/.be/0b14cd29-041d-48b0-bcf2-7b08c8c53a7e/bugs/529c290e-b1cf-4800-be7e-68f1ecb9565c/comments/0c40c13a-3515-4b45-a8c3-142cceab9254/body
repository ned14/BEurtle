  This is actually the main reason I've manually mirrored the tree in
the past, so that users of our projects can get BE.  If tarballs were
available I probably wouldn't even bother, but bzr really isn't a nice
dependency for just submitting/commenting on bugs.

  Isn't there a bzr web interface that at least supports creating
tarballs/zips?  It is pretty standard functionality for most other VCS'
web interfaces so I'm guessing there must be, but loggerhead seems not
to support it.

  If it is a case of not having the hardware to host a more featureful
web UI I may be able to offer some assistance.

  Both approaches seem pretty odd to me, as a user you would have no
idea if 0.1.200910302359 has the fixes you required in a release you
were using that was numbered 0.1.200907141554.  Surely you'd at least be
{pre,suf}fixing a branch name to the version.
