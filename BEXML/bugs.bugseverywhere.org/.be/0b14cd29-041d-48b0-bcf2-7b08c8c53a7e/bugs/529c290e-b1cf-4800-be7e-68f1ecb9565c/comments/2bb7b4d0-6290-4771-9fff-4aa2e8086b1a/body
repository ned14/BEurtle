I think I have a better understanding of why this apparent disagreement
occurred, and it was due to my sloppy use of terms.

Looking into it further, it seems there is a certain expectation (set,
in part, by the long-standing GNU coding conventions) that a “GNU-style
ChangeLog” contains not only a particular *format*, but information at
a particular level of *detail*.

That is, a GNU ChangeLog is intended for the style of work where one
logs all the changes made to every file in the tree each working day,
and then makes a new day's entry above that, and so on. This is, of
course, entirely redundant with a VCS revision history, which makes all
the commit messages available on request.

So to disambiguate, that's not what I meant. I'm more familiar with a
less-frequently-updated and less-fine-detail change log; perhaps more
akin to the GNU-style “NEWS” file.

Yes, that's mostly what I meant.

I actually don't think the commit log needs to be part of the release at
all. It's of interest only to those who want fine-level detail about
changes to every file, and for that purpose I think read access to the
VCS is much better. Packaging a static copy of the commit log as plain
text seems pointless.

Rather, we should treat a user-changes level “NEWS” file (or whatever
name we choose for it) as part of the documentation, and set the
expectation among the team that it will be updated for each user-visible
change being worked on, like any other documentation.
