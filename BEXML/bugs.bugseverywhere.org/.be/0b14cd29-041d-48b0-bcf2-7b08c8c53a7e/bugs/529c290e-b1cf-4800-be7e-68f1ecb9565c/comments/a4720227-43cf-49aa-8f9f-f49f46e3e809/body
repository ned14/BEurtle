Sounds good to me.  Not that my tree is much ahead of the trunk at the
moment.  We've talked over most of these issues a few times, so I'll
just summarize where I think we stand on the steps needed to make a
release.

** cfbe integration

Postpone until we work out bzr/hg versioning [1]?

** Conventional version number

Set to "1.0.0" using libbe.version._VERSION.

** NEWS file

Depending on our level of masochism, either something starting out
along the lines of [2]
  bzr log --gnu-changelog -n1 -r 200..
(commit 200, or
  aaron.bentley@utoronto.ca-20060411035623-9b8d222282a26ce1
 was the last time anyone touched the NEWS file),
or a much abbreviated entry [3,4], along the lines of my current NEWS
file (changed just a few minutes ago).

** Tag bzr commit

  bzr tag 1.0.0

** Create tarball

From Ben[5]:
  bzr export /tmp/be-1.0.0.tar.gz
