Howdy all,

Currently, the code and interface of Bugs Everywhere speaks loosely
about the term “RCS”. Sometimes it means “revision control system”
referring in general to these types of system, and sometimes it talks
about GNU RCS, a specific system.

I propose that “Version Control System” (“VCS”) has emerged as a
consensus term to refer to such systems in general, with no specific
reference to any particular system.

So I'd like to modify the Bugs Everywhere code to disambiguate: the term
“VCS” will be used consistently to refer to version control systems in
general, and “RCS” will only ever refer to GNU RCS.

This will change some interface (e.g. the ‘rcs_name’ configuration
setting, and some of the methods on objects), but making this change
while Bugs Everywhere is small will be much less painful than making it
later.

Any objections? Any alternative suggestions?
