I don't think we ever rever to GNU RCS.  Our current libbe.rcs.RCS
default implementation is a "don't version" backend for BE, but
perhaps this is what you're refereing to.

Hmm, we really need a method for upgrading the on-disk BugDir version.
It's hard when you need to maintain backwards compatibilty with
earlier versions in the VCS history....
