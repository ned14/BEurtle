Does anyone know of any output-abstraction implementations to look at
for inspiration.
  * How would we handle the options we currently pass through
    (shortlist, show_comments, etc.)?
  * Would standard arguments know how to display themselves?
    class Status (Argument):
        def str(self, ui, command, *args, **kwargs):
            ui.display_status(self, command, *args, **kwargs)
    class Bug (Argument):
        def str(self, ui, command, *args, **kwargs):
            ui.display_bug(self, command, *args, **kwargs)
    ...
