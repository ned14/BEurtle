-1. It's up to the local operating system configuration to set a default
EDITOR value, and up to the user to over-ride that if they want to. An
application shouldn't be guessing in the absence of those conventions.

The behaviour is clear and the message provides a way for the user to
rectify the problem in a standard way. It doesn't need to change.
