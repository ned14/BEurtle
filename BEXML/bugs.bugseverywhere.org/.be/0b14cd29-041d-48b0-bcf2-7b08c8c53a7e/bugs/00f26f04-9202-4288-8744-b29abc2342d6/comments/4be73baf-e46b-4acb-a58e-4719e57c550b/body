The FSF offices are no longer at Temple Place, and there is a revised
text of the GPLv2 giving the correct address and other textual
clean-ups. 

The COPYING file should be updated to the new GPLv2 text, and the
copyright notices throughout the working tree should be updated for
the new boilerplate how-to-use-the-GPL text.
